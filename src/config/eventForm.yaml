  - title: Invitation Policy
    description: |
      The Bawdy Shop has a few different levels of engagement. By default any event placed on the calendar is open to all members of the **Bawdy Besties**, a group of about 15 people who have increased stewardship of the space.

      In addition, the **Bawdy Buddies** represents a larger group of people who have been to the Bawdy Shop for a previous event and expressed interest in future large events. If you are trying to increase your reach, consider inviting the Bawdy Buddies.

      Otherwise inviting the Bawdy Besties can provide internal appreciation and facilitation resources. **Private events** are also welcome, though in most cases, there will be at least one facilitator from the Bawdy Besties on site as a resource.
