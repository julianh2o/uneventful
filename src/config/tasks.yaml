    summary: Add the event to the Bawdy Shop Google Calendar with all details

      **All events must be on the Bawdy Shop Google Calendar.**

      If you do not have access to this calendar, you must coordinate with someone who does to ensure your event appears there.

      **Important Steps:**
      - Check if you have calendar access by visiting [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=OTAxYTEyNzYyMjhmYjY2MjYxYmZkN2RkMjcxODNlNDE2NjQ3MzZlODNiOWJhNWJhZGU0ZmZmZmZlNzdiZDJiZEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) while logged into Google
      - Ensure the calendar event's description clearly lists the invitation policy, hosts, and expectations
      - If you need someone else to create the event, ask them to do so. For help, contact: julianh2o@gmail.com
      - If you create an Event Poster, upload it to the Event Posters folder in Google Drive and link to it in the calendar event
      - For broader audience events, consider adding `bawdybuddies@googlegroups.com` as a guest to email-blast the list and provide an RSVP avenue

    name: Create Event Poster
    summary: Design promotional materials and graphics for the event
    description: |
      Event posters provide an easy way of sharing details about an upcoming event. They're especially useful for sharing an event on Instagram for a larger audience, and they're a fun graphical piece that will become a lasting part of Bawdy Shop history.

      **REQUIRED for events with more than 20 people. OPTIONAL for smaller events.**

      **Important Notes:**

      - The best way to make these is with the [Event Posters Canva document](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG1y0CJNlY/Q4hFLOYJqT7MUxlykBbfvQ/edit)—just copy an existing page, or start one from scratch.
      - Using your own method or tool to create posters is fine, but it is strongly recommended to use a size of 1080 x 1350 for consistency and Instagram-friendliness.
      - For large parties, do *not* include the address of the Bawdy Shop or individual phone numbers on the poster. People can get in touch via Instagram.

    summary: Check and report supplies, inventory, and any damage
    description: |
      Hosts are expected to perform basic inventory during the process of setup or cleanup of an event. This is essential to making sure the Bawdy Shop stays functional for future events.

      While explicitly checking each item at the completion of a party is not required, get in the habit of making mental notes when passing through these areas and explicitly check the bigger ones that are being used by your event (e.g., toilet paper).

      Any items running low, depleted, damaged, or of note should be reported in the appropriate channel or to your coordination contact.
